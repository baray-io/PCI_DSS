# Summary of Requirement #2: No Defaults

Requirement #2, known as "No Defaults", goes beyond changing default settings and passwordsâ€”it aims to minimize vulnerabilities by eliminating obvious risks and patching potential vulnerabilities. This philosophy of preventing problems extends to addressing stupid mistakes and obvious security flaws.

## Sub-Requirements:

1. **Changing or Disabling Defaults:** Ensure all default passwords, accounts, connection strings, and other defaults are changed or disabled to prevent easy exploitation.

2. **Setting Configuration Standards:** Establish configuration standards that address vulnerabilities, including removing unnecessary functionality and securing critical systems.

3. **Encrypting Admin Access:** Encrypt all admin access to minimize the risk of credentials interception, especially in internal networks.

4. **Inventorying Assets:** Conduct an inventory of all assets within the scope of PCI-DSS to ensure comprehensive protection, with the focus being a signal of proper asset management.

5. **Documenting and Enforcing Policies:** Document and enforce formal policies and procedures for addressing vulnerabilities and securing systems.

6. **Securing Shared Service Provider Functions:** For service providers, ensure isolation of client data to prevent cross-contamination and unauthorized access.

Each sub-requirement emphasizes the importance of proactive measures to address vulnerabilities and mitigate risks effectively. Whether it's changing defaults, securing admin access, maintaining an asset inventory, or enforcing policies, Requirement #2 underscores the necessity of robust security practices to safeguard systems and data effectively.
