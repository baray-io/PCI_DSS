3. **Develop Usage Policies:** Define usage policies specifying acceptable technology usage, access controls, and acceptable network locations and products, including restrictions on moving cardholder data to local machines.

4. **Define Security Responsibilities:** Assign clear security responsibilities to all personnel, ensuring each task and asset has an assigned owner responsible for its protection and maintenance.

5. **Assign Security Responsibilities:** Identify and assign specific security responsibilities for key tasks and assets, including policy dissemination, user account monitoring, security log monitoring, and incident response procedures.

7. **Screen Potential Personnel:** Conduct thorough background checks, criminal record checks, and reference checks on potential personnel before hiring them to minimize internal security risks.

11. **Quarterly Service Provider Reviews:** If functioning as a service provider, conduct quarterly reviews of security policies and procedures, including logs, firewall rules, incident response procedures, and change management processes.

Requirement #12 emphasizes the importance of comprehensive policy development, risk assessment, personnel screening, and incident response planning to ensure effective information security management.
