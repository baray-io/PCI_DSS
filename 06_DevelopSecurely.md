# Summary of Requirement #6: Develop Securely

Requirement #6, titled "Develop and maintain secure systems and applications," emphasizes the need for incorporating security measures into both the development process and the lifecycle of software applications, particularly those handling sensitive Cardholder Data (CHD). This requirement aims to ensure that security considerations are integral to all stages of software development and maintenance.

## Sub-Requirements:

1. **Perform Regular Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Ranking:** Conduct ongoing vulnerability assessments and rank identified risks to prioritize patch installation, addressing critical vulnerabilities promptly to mitigate potential threats.

2. **Timely Patch Installation:** Install patches for identified vulnerabilities within specified timeframes, with critical patches required to be implemented within 30 days, and other lower-risk patches within 2 to 3 months.

3. **Implement Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Incorporate security requirements into the software development process to ensure developers adhere to secure coding practices and integrate security measures from the outset.

4. **Enforce Development Change Controls:** Implement controls to evaluate the impact of software changes on security, conduct security testing after significant changes, and maintain rollback options in case of adverse effects.

5. **Provide Secure Development Training:** Train developers on secure coding practices to mitigate common vulnerabilities such as code injection, buffer overflows, cross-site scripting (XSS), and improper error handling.

6. **Address Public Vulnerabilities for Public-Facing Applications:** Conduct frequent testing and assessment of public-facing applications to prevent and mitigate vulnerabilities, with testing required at least once a year or upon significant changes.

7. **Document and Enforce Policies and Procedures:** Document all security policies and procedures related to software development, training, vulnerability assessment, patch management, and change controls, and ensure their enforcement across the organization.

Each sub-requirement underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to software security, encompassing vulnerability assessment, patch management, secure coding practices, training, and rigorous testing to identify and mitigate potential risks.
