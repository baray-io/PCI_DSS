# Summary of Requirement #4: Protect Transmitted Data

Requirement #4, titled "Protect Transmitted Data," addresses the need to secure data in transit, contrasting with Requirement #3 which focuses on protecting data at rest. This requirement emphasizes the protection of Cardholder Data (CHD) while being transmitted across public networks, including protocols like WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM, GPS, and satellite.

## Sub-Requirements:

1. **Use Strong Encryption and Security:** Employ robust encryption protocols and security measures for data transmission over public networks, avoiding deprecated or weak encryption methods like WEP and ensuring acceptance of only trusted keys and certificates.

2. **Avoid Sending Unprotected Personal Account Numbers (PANs):** Prohibit the transmission of PANs in plaintext via instant messaging applications, SMS, or email, emphasizing encryption or masking if PANs must be transmitted, and establish clear policies and procedures for secure transmission.

3. **Document and Enforce Policies:** Formalize and enforce policies and procedures regarding encryption protocols, transmission practices, and the prohibition of sending PANs in plaintext, ensuring adherence among all relevant employees.

Each sub-requirement underscores the importance of employing strong encryption methods, avoiding plaintext transmission of PANs, and implementing clear policies to ensure compliance and data security during transmission across public networks.
