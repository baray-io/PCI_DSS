# Summary of Requirement #9: Restrict Physical Access

Requirement #9, titled "Restrict physical access to Cardholder Data (CHD)," focuses on implementing physical controls to protect premises, personnel, and physical media containing Cardholder Data (CHD). It parallels the digital access control measures outlined in Requirement #7 but addresses physical security aspects. The requirement encompasses various sub-requirements, each targeting specific aspects of physical access control and security measures.

## Sub-Requirements:

1. **Enforce Entry Controls:** Implement entry controls such as cameras or access control systems at all entry and exit points to areas containing Card Data Environment (CDE) systems and data. Maintain and monitor records of entry data for 90 days.

2. **Distinguish Visitors:** Clearly distinguish visitors from personnel through different identification methods such as badge color coding and limit their access permissions. Ensure proper termination of visitor access upon departure.

3. **Restrict Physical Access:** Limit access to areas where Cardholder Data is processed or stored to authorized personnel only. Apply access control measures to minimize access to sensitive locations.

4. **Authorize Visitors:** Accompany visitors in sensitive areas, provide them with identifiable badges, maintain visitor logs, and retrieve expired badges upon departure.

5. **Securely Store Media:** Store physical media containing Cardholder Data securely in locked rooms with access control mechanisms, including biometric authentication.

6. **Securely Distribute Media:** Establish processes for securely transporting media containing card data, including tracking shipments and obtaining management approval for transport.

7. **Maintain Strict Media Storage and Accessibility:** Maintain an inventory of all physical media with Cardholder Data, conduct regular reviews, and ensure immediate detection of missing or compromised media.

8. **Securely Destroy Unneeded Media:** Safely destroy physical media containing Cardholder Data using approved methods such as shredding, burning, or degaussing. Obtain certificates of destruction for documentation.

9. **Protect Devices Capturing Card Data:** Safeguard devices such as Point-of-Sale (POS) systems from tampering and train personnel to detect and report suspicious activity.

10. **Document and Enforce Policies and Procedures:** Document all physical access control measures, visitor policies, media handling procedures, and staff training initiatives. Enforce compliance with these policies and procedures.

Each sub-requirement emphasizes the importance of implementing robust physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to Cardholder Data and ensure compliance with security protocols.
