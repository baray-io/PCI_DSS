# Summary of Requirement #1: Keep a Firewall

Requirement #1, "Keep a Firewall", entails more than merely blocking connectionsâ€”it requires sophistication in managing the firewall itself. This involves configuration management, restricted access to configuration files, and other measures to ensure advanced firewall functionality.

## Sub-Requirements:

1. **Setting Configuration Standards:** Establish standards for traffic configurations, security protocols, and firewall rules, while documenting network topology and card data flows.

2. **Restricting Connections Between Untrusted Networks:** Deny unauthorized traffic and position firewalls at all access points to the Card Data Environment (CDE).

3. **Prohibiting Direct Access from the Internet:** Establish a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) for triage, use anti-spoofing measures, and prevent direct access from the internet to the CDE.

4. **Installing Firewall Software on Portable Computers:** Install firewall software on all portable computers accessing the CDE, and enforce this without allowing individual users to modify settings.

5. **Documenting and Enforcing Policies and Procedures:** Document and enforce all policies and procedures related to firewall management and network security.

Each sub-requirement emphasizes the importance of formal processes, regular reviews, and staff training to ensure compliance and minimize vulnerabilities. Overall, Requirement #1 emphasizes not only the presence of a firewall but also its proper configuration, documentation, and management in a sophisticated manner to safeguard the Card Data Environment.
