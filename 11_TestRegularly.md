# Summary of Requirement #11: Test Regularly

Requirement #11, also known as "Regularly Test Security Systems and Processes," focuses on conducting regular testing to detect and address vulnerabilities in both physical and logical security systems. The requirement encompasses various testing methods aimed at preventing and mitigating security threats. Here's an overview of its key sub-requirements:

1. **Detect Access Points:** Conduct periodic scans to identify both authorized and unauthorized Access Points (APs) internally, with a quarterly frequency, and establish Incident Response (IR) procedures to address rogue APs.

2. **Perform Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans, or after significant changes, by an Approved Scan Vendor (ASV), ensuring a CVSS score of 3.9 or lower and addressing high-risk vulnerabilities.

3. **Conduct Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing at least annually, following a documented methodology, to simulate real-world attacks on vulnerabilities, providing recommendations for improvements.

4. **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy IDS/IPS systems covering critical points within the Card Data Environment (CDE) and keep them updated to detect and prevent intrusions.

5. **Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Deploy FIM systems to monitor critical files for unauthorized changes, such as system files, configuration files, and logs, with weekly checks and defined Incident Response procedures.

6. **Document and Enforce Policies and Procedures:** Document all testing techniques, schedules, actions, and tools, ensuring compliance and enforcement by employees.

These sub-requirements emphasize the importance of proactive testing to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities, both internally and externally. Compliance with Requirement #11 helps organizations strengthen their security posture and reduce the risk of security breaches.
