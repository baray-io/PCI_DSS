# Summary of Requirement #8: Identify Access

Requirement #8, titled "Identify and authenticate access to system components," emphasizes the principle of non-repudiation, ensuring that every action taken within the system is associated with a specific user without ambiguity. The requirement focuses on implementing robust identification and authentication measures to enhance accountability and security.

## Sub-Requirements:

1. **Implement Identification Management Procedures:** Ensure that every user has a unique ID, manage access revocation for deleted or inactive accounts, and set automatic lockouts and logouts for security purposes.

2. **Enforce Strong Authentication:** Mandate strong authentication measures such as passwords with strict standards, encryption of passwords during transmission and storage, and verification of user identity before any major credential changes.

3. **Require Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all access to Card Data Environment (CDE) systems or data, requiring at least two authentication methods to enhance security.

4. **Document and Enforce Policies and Procedures:** Document and enforce all practices related to password management, MFA, and user identification to ensure compliance and adherence to security protocols.

5. **Avoid Group or Shared IDs:** Prohibit the use of group, shared, or generic IDs to ensure that every action within the system is attributable to an identifiable user.

6. **Implement Individual Physical Security Measures:** Utilize individual physical security measures such as smart cards, fobs, or identity badges that are unique to each user and cannot be shared among multiple individuals.

7. **Restrict Database Access to Administrators:** Limit direct database access to database administrators only, ensuring that other users access card data through designated interfaces or applications.

8. **Document and Enforce Policies and Procedures:** Document and enforce all policies and procedures related to unique physical access measures, database access restrictions, and the avoidance of shared user IDs.

Each sub-requirement emphasizes the importance of implementing stringent identification and authentication measures to achieve non-repudiation and enhance security within the system.
